# -Group11-BioAcoustic-Deterrence-System
Artificial Bio Acoustics Scarecrow Predator Deterrence System for identifying and deterring predators using image processing and sound.
## Overview
This project, developed by Group 11, is a bioacoustic deterrent system designed to identify and deter predators using real-time image processing and predator-specific sounds.

## Subsystems
- **Detection and Identification**: Uses camera + PIR + server-side ML.
- **Deterrence**: Plays predator-specific sounds via PAM8403 amplifier and speaker.
- **User Interface**: Dashboard and alerts for conservation monitoring.
